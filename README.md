## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea
Virtual Boardroom Experience: Simulates a real-life boardroom setting with interactive questioning and progressive discussions, starting with ice-breaking questions and advancing to detailed subject-specific queries.

AI-Powered Question Generation: Uses AI to generate domain-specific questions tailored to the candidate’s expertise and job role.

Automated Evaluation and Scoring: AI-driven assessment of candidate responses based on relevance, accuracy, and technical depth. Experts and AI can jointly evaluate responses for objectivity.

Bias-Free and Transparent Process: Ensures a fair and objective interview process through AI moderation and scoring transparency.

Comprehensive Reporting and Insights: Generates detailed reports highlighting candidate performance metrics, strengths, and improvement areas for informed decision-making.
